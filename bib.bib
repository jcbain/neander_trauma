  \\
  \textbf{Methods:} Several Neanderthal specimens fossils were included in this study, six human samples (3 archaoeological and 3 3 clinical), and a sample of rodeo riders. Traumatic lesions were tabulated from the Neanderthals and humans samples. These injuries were categorized by anatomical distribution: head/neck, trunk, shoulder/arm, hand, pelvis, leg, and foot. 
  \\
  \textbf{Results:} Neanderthals exhibit more head and neck injuries that that of the clinical and archaeological samples at 30.4\%. Although, in some of the regions they have similar incidents of trauma, Neanderthals are overall unique in their distribution, except for the rodeo sample, which exhibits a very similar pattern. },

  \textbf{Methods:} The four combat sports analyzed in this study were boxing, taekwondo, kickboxing, and Muay Thai. Data were collected on male from 2005 to 2009. Injuries were examined and diagnosed by a team of physicians. Type of injury (laceration, fracture, jaw dislocation, etc.) and location (jaw, nose, malar bone, teeth, etc.) were recorded.
  \\
  \textbf{Results:} There were 120 subjects recruited for this study.  Of those, 95 (79.2\%) sustained at least one injury to the maxillofacial region. Facial laceration were present for 69.2\% of the injuries. Bone fractures and dental injuries were present on 45.1\% and 44.2\%, respectively. Finally, jaw dislocation occurred 6.7\% of the time. Overall, kickboxing accounted for the majority of the maxillofacial injuries out of the four sports, while Muay Thai claimed the most facial lacerations (93.3\%).}

Only those individuals with at least one year of experience were included in the study. Final count of participants was 152.

  \textbf{Results:} There were 19 beginners, 82 amateurs, and 51 professionals (132 men and 20 women) recruited. Injuries that were recorded were contusions, lacerations, sprains/strains, and fractures. Of these, the most common across groups were lacerations and contusions.  The second most common for beginners and amateurs was sprains/strains, however, for professionals it was fractures. Anatomical distribution of injuries were differentiated based on level of experience. For beginners, the lower extremities (75\%) was the most affected, then the trunk (15.9\%), followed by the upper extremities (6.8\%), and finally the head (2.3\%). For amateurs and professionals, the lower extremities were still injured the most (64\% and 53\% respectively) and the head was the second most common injury (31\% amateurs and 42.5\% professionals).  }

  \textbf{Methods:} From the years of 1995 to 1998, varsity athletes were studied using data gathered from 246 athletic programs across the United States. Sports included boys and girls soccer, basketball, boys baseball, and girls softball. In sum, there were 8988 reported injuries (4559 (50.7\%) boys, 4429 (49.3\%) girls). Types of injuries included sprains/strains, contusions, neurotrauma, fractures, and muscul0skeletal conditions. Area of the body that was injured was also reported.
  \\
  \textbf{Results:} Anatomical distribution of trauma was fairly similar between males and females between the different sports.  However, females tend to get injured more than males in the majority of sports.
  \\ \\
  \textit{Baseball vs. Softball} Softball had a 27\% higher rate of injuries that baseball. The most likely part of the body to be injured in these two sports was the forearm/wrist/hand region contributing to 22.9\% of softball injuries and 24.6\% of baseball. Second would be the shoulder/arm region accounting for 16.3\% for softball injuries and 19.7\% for baseball injuries.
  \\ \\ 
  \textit{Basketball} The injury rate was slightly higher for girls basketball than boys, although the difference was not significant ($P$= 0.64). The ankle/foot region was the most highly affected region (36.6\% girls, 39.3\% boys).
  \\ \\ 
  \textit{Soccer} Girls soccer experiences 14\% more injuries than boys soccer. The most injured body area for both sexes was the ankle/foot region, 33.5\% for girls and 33.3\% for boys. Hip/thigh/leg region was the second most affected area (25.8\% girls, 28\% boys).

Those who were uninjured were significantly younger as well as less experienced ($P$ $<$ 0.5) than those who had received an injury. The majority of the injuries occurred to the lower limb, followed by the head and face region, and then the upper limb and torso.  The majority of these were ankle sprains followed by contusions then fractures. Considering the different players, 58\% of the injuries belonged to goalies.}

Trainers used a protocol when reporting an injury when one occurred. They took information about the athlete, type of injury, and body category.

  \textbf{Results:} Data on 3195 team-seasons, 75298 player-seasons, and 23566 reported injuries were collected. Football players suffered the most injuries overall while volleyball players were injured the least. Aggregated means also revealed that most athletes were injured during practice 55.5\% of the time. For the majority of sports, the lower extremities (59.9\%) accounted for the majority of the injuries when compared to the upper extremities (20.8\%), except for wrestling. Football had the most incidents of head/neck/spine injuries at 13.3\%.}

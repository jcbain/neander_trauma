Neanderthals have an unusual distribution of skeletal trauma, with high levels of head trauma and few pelvis and lower limb injuries.  In their now classic paper, Berger and Trinkaus (1995) compared these patterns of trauma to both archaeological populations and modern hospital samples, in order to shed light on the types of activity patterns that may have led to the relatively unique anatomical distribution of Neandertal trauma.  We revisit this topic using a dramatically expanded comparative sample from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), which includes 84 sets of trauma data from different sports and activitie (n=61,667).  When the pattern of injury in these living samples was compared to that of Neanderals, 70 groups were significantly different from Neandertals.   Of the 14 activities not statistically significantly different, it was difficult to hypothesize analogous behaviors in Neanderthals. These include activities such as water tubing (p = 0.812), flying disks and boomerang games (p = 0.077), and accidents involving a golf cart (p = 0.126). It is possible that this method of drawing comparisons between patterns of Pliestocene trauma and those of modern sports samples may be problematic due to issues of survivorship and small fossil sample size.  Alternatively, it also remains possible injury distribution data provides insufficient resolution to interpret past behaviors, due to the wide variety of specific activity patterns that can generate a single distribution pattern.

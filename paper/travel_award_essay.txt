“Hey, Jane, you doing alright?”

“Oh, hey, Chuck. I’m applying to these Anthro programs, and I can’t decide whether or not I want be a Biological Anthropologist or a Physical Anthropologist.”

“Hmm…that’s a tough one. Wait! What’s the difference again? Physical has something to do with the Physics of Anthropology, right? Like a monkey in motion remains in motion type of stuff?”

"That's the thing, they are the same discipline but with two different names. The NSF actually changed the name funding program to Biological Anthropology a few years back, but Physical Anthropology is rich with history."
